# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

So far code has been relatively simple. thankfully nothing too challenging.
Glad i am getting familiar with git. I was worried that if i did not use it much then i would forget what i had learn previously.

the code itself was relatively straight forward. created a short word list that the code may select at random.
and so far the code takes an input which would be the letter the player has guessed.
the input then has a simple assessment performed to see if it meets some basic criteria such as only a single character being guessed and it is in fact a letter of the alphabet
