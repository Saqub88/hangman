# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 2
So far code has been relatively simple. thankfully nothing too challenging.
Glad i am getting familiar with git. I was worried that if i did not use it much then i would forget what i had learn previously.

the code itself was relatively straight forward. created a short word list that the code may select at random.
and so far the code takes an input which would be the letter the player has guessed.
the input then has a simple assessment performed to see if it meets some basic criteria such as only a single character being guessed and it is in fact a letter of the alphabet

## Milestone 3
A little more complicated on this time around. I decided to assist with troubleshooting the code, i used set words and guesses and this proved quite useful when converting our previous pieces of code into 2 functions. The function which assessed the input gave the most trouble whereas the function which checks if the character is in the word or not behaved as intended right from the start. 

instructions requested the use of "while True:" and a break statement so managed to implement these. although i do feel they may not have been needed. I may revisit it later on to write a cleaner function. and when placing to a function code the function needs to return the updated guess.

## Milestone 4
This milestone provided a bid step towards producing a functionng game. there were some challenges along the way. The game appears to function well but i would like to enhance the user experience by having the game offer info back to the player by offering more details on what letters have been played already, the puzzle so far and even how many lives remaining on each turn regardless of whether as right or wrong answer has been given. i hope to achieve some of this on the next milestone when compiling the final finished game.
